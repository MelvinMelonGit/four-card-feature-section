Front-end Mentor Challenge - Four Card Feature Section

Hi there! Thanks for viewing my solution :)

Just a few questions.

1 - The design looks fine on most screen sizes, but when I view it on a extremely wide desktop screen, it appears very tiny on the browser. Please advise on how I may get this to work.

2 - Please advise how I may improve on my code.

Thanks again!
